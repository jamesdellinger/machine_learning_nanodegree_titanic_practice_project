### Topic: Introduction and Foundations

### Overview:

* This is the first, ***optional***, project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

In this project you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.
