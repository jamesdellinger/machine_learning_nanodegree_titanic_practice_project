### Topic: Introduction and Foundations

### Overview:

* In this project I created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as gender, age, and ticket class.
* I started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.
* This entailed investigating the dataset's various features in order to determine which have the strongest correlation with passenger survival.
* The dataset comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

### Concepts:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Dataset exploration
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter notebooks
* Feature selection
* Supervised learning
